# SQL assets

The SQL assets are organised by purpose:

- `ddl/`: Data definition scripts grouped by module.
- `dml/`: Data manipulation scripts (placeholder directory for future use).
- `modules/`: PL/SQL modules such as packages, procedures and functions.

Each subdirectory can contain further folders to group related artefacts (for example `env_sync_capture`).
